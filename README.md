# Berkshire Portfolio Analysis

This repository attempts to deconstruct and analyse the Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio and is split into 3 different notebooks:

1) Portfolio Decomposition: Decomposes the BRKA portfolio using the popular CAPM and Fama-French 5 Factor models to analyse investor views
2) Efficient Frontier: Attempts to construct an optimal portfolio using mean-variance optimization with EF plot
3) Black-Litterman: Factors in personal investment views using the Black-Litterman model to construct suitable portfolio allocations

I would also highly recommend the EDHEC coursera course which I have based most of the learning materials from.
