# Berkshire Portfolio Analysis

This repository attempts to deconstruct and analyse the Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio and is split into 3 different notebooks:

i) Portfolio Decomposition: Decomposes the BRKA portfolio using the popular CAPM and Fama-French 5 Factor models to analyse investor views
ii) Efficient Frontier: Attempts to construct an optimal portfolio using mean-variance optimization with EF plot
iii) Black-Litterman: Factors in personal investment views using the Black-Litterman model to construct suitable portfolio allocations
 
 I intend to use this repo for conducting quant finance workshops at NTU, to give retail investors an insight and edge with optimizing their personal investment risks and portfolios.
